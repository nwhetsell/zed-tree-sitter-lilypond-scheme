This is a Tree-sitter parser for use with https://github.com/nwhetsell/lilypond-zed-extension.
This is necessary because the [Tree-sitter grammar on which this parser is based](https://github.com/nwhetsell/tree-sitter-lilypond)
supports multiple languages, and Zed extensions do not support this
configuration of Tree-sitter.

Issues with this parser should be reported at
https://github.com/nwhetsell/lilypond-zed-extension
or
https://github.com/nwhetsell/tree-sitter-lilypond.

The files in this repository are automatically synced from files in

repository will be closed without comment.)
